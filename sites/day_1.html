        The module started off with an introduction to the topic of generative
        computergraphics. In order to warm up we did a physical game called
        <strong><a href="https://nrich.maths.org/2413">Sprouts Game</a></strong
        >.

        The idea is that two players play against each other by connecting
        points on a paper. There are multiple rules that constrain the players
        ability to choose which points he wants to connect. All rules can be
        found in the linked article above. Here are the outcomes of my games
        against my opponent.

        I was quite astonished about the maths and logical backgrounds behind
        this very simple game. I read the whole article on my busdrive home but
        skipped the concrete interpreatations of the maths. I didn't quite
        figure it out but i have a strong feeling that depending on the number
        of starting points the player who starts either tends to win or loose
        the game. Similar to the game <strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong>. If both
        players understand the logic behind the game, the number of starting
        points defines if the starting player wins or looses. But that's just a
        theory which I can't confirm at the moment :)

        In the afternoon we were free to start developing some digital work. I
        decided to go with the task to draw a map of an imaginary place and
        combined it with some warming up in the P5JS library. I wanted to do a
        basic 2D perlin noise grayscale map.

        It reminds me a bit of an thermal camera from a flying drone over some
        unknown territory, so I tried to make the noise move from right to left.
