        What is a drawing machine? I asked myself that question several times.
        Basically every sketch we do with p5 is a drawing machine. We give the
        system some input, define a ruleset by writing conditional structures in
        code and the program draws something for us.
      </article>
      <article>
        What makes a drawing machine is the fact that the program manipulates
        the input we give it in an unpredictable manner. We do have some way of
        controlling the drawing machine, but since it is a machine, it distorts
        the input we give and comes up with something we didn't plan upfront.

        I decided that I want to create my own input system. I wanted to have
        some camera input and have it so, that the viewer can draw something by
        moving infront of the camera. My idea was, that the user could use his
        smartphone flashlight to draw on the canvas.

        Also your PC might struggle on this page because the calculation are
        quite heavy on your CPU. All sketches are embedded via IFrames and are
        all loaded and processed simultaneously.

        In the code I search for the brightest pixel in the camera input and
        draw a circle at that position.
      </article>
      <div class="grid_2x1">
        <pre class="prettyprint">
        // the rgba values of each pixel
        let r = camInput.pixels[loc];
        let g = camInput.pixels[loc + 1];
        let b = camInput.pixels[loc + 2];
        let a = camInput.pixels[loc + 3];
        // a color object provided by the p5 library
        let c = color(r, g, b, a);
        // here i check the brightness of the pixel
        let bright = brightness(c);
        // i save a position reference to the brightest pixel
        if (bright > brightestValue) {
          brightestValue = bright;
          brightestPixelIndex = loc;
          xPos = map(x, 0, width / rasterizeDivider, width, 0);
          yPos = map(y, 0, height / rasterizeDivider, 0, height);
        }

          The problem is, that depending on the lighting conditions there may be
          other pixels just as bright (255, 255, 255 -> pure white) as the ones
          coming from the flashlight. Also there is a reflection of the light in
          the camera lens which is hard to control. The code will simply pick
          the first completely white pixel and go with that. Not very good...

        I decided to use another property than brightness, since this can be
        quite hard to control. In this example the code will look for the pixel
        with the highest red value.

        You can reset the drawing by clicking on the canvas and then pressing
        <strong>R</strong> on your keyboard.

          let g = camInput.pixels[loc + 1];
          let b = camInput.pixels[loc + 2];
    
          // instead of checking for brightness, I check for the purest red since white also has a red value of 255
          if (r > rMax && g < gMin && b < bMin) {
            rMax = r;
            gMin = g;
            bMin = b;
            xPos = map(x, 0, width / rasterizeDivider, width, 0);

        Obviously this aproach suffers from the same problems as the one before,
        but it's a bit easier to control wheter or not red items are in the view
        of the camera. Now it's time to come up with some creative ideas on how
        to draw something better than just green dots. To be honest, what I came
        up with is not really useful, nor is it aesthetically pleasing. If I
        find the time, i'll come back to this and try to do something more
        satisfying. Also here you can reset the drawing by giving focus to the
        canvas by clicking on it and then pressing <strong>R</strong>.
