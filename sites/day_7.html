        Pixels right? I wanna do more with pixels! I overhauled my inital idea
        of swapping pixels because the outcome didn't convince me at all.

      <article>
        So, I want to swap pixels again, but not without a purpose. The idea is,
        that I prvovide the code with two images. My program will analyze the
        images for all its pixels and then try to reconstruct one image with the
        pixels from the other image. To make this more clear. All pixels in one
        image will be rearanged, but not changed in their values. The slider in
        the top left defines "how hard" the program tries to match the original
        image. If the slider is all the way to the right, you will simply see
        the source image, because it doesn't try at all to match the original
        image at all. If the slider is all the way to the left it matches the
        image as good as possible.

          Trying to replicate the image as close as possible might take a
          considerable amount of time!

          The images are downscaled in order to decrease the processing time.

        Now comes the part i'm definetly most excited and proud of. In this
        example the "matching factor" changes over time from
        <strong> "not matching at all"</strong> to
        <strong> "match as close as possible"</strong>. Keep in mind that pixels
        are only changing positions but do NOT change it's color values!
