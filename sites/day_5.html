        Now things start to get really interesting! We're supposed to generate
        and draw faces. From what i've learned about camera input yesterday, I
        knew i wanted to to something with the camera again. So I started
        brainstorming and developing ideas.

            I used a library called <strong>Mediapipe</strong> which provides a
            model trained by AI, which is able to detect and track a face from
            camera input. Using this library its quite easy to look up positions
            from different parts of the face.

            project.

          // the vertices array contains data points provided by the Mediapipe library
          // connectionIndices represents an array of concrete indices as defined above

          for (let i = 0; i < connectionIndices.length; i++) {
            const vertexPoint = vertices[connectionIndices[i]];
            curveVertex(vertexPoint[0], vertexPoint[1]);

        Because of some scaling issues with iframes and the used tracking
        library the drawn face might not be visible because it's drawn outside
        the iframe! Try moving your head to the top right in that case.

        Also your PC might struggle on this page because the calculation through
        mediapipe are quite heavy on your CPU. All sketches are embedded via
        IFrame and are all loaded and processed simultaneously.

        From this first working example I moved on and introduced some
        parameters to randomly change the attributes of the face, such as the
        nose, the eyes, the mouth and the outline. Also I added a "filter" that
        adds a sketchy look to the drawn lines. I accomplished that by reading
        the pixel data after connecting and drawing the face and calculating a
        grayscale value based on perlin noise.

        Now, that's good and all but I wanted more! The pixel manipulation
        seemed very promising to me, so I went ahead and tried to do mroe with
        it. I ended up with the idea to distort the pixel positions by a noise
        value instead of it's color value. Also I wanted to render this in
        realtime, because I really like the interactive aspect.
